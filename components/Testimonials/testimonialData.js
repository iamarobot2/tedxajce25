      " “ Organizing the first-ever TEDx event at our college was an incredibly exhilarating experience. We faced numerous challenges from the brainstorming to the execution phase, which only added to the excitement. As the event date approached, a mix of nerves and anticipation enveloped the team. On the day of the event, we felt an overwhelming sense of pride and achievement as everything fell seamlessly into place. ”",

      "“ Organizing a TEDx event is no easy feat. It requires several months of preparation and planning. And when the pandemic hit, things weren't exactly looking good. We had no choice but to work online. However, we had an amazing team of volunteers spread across the world, and I have to say, we did pull off something remarkable. It was amazing to see how a group of dedicated people can achieve something when we all have one mission. ”"

    quote: "“I have been lucky enough to be part of the first two editions of TEDxAJCE. First as a member of the organising team and then as the principal organiser. It remains as one of the highlights of my time at Amal Jyothi. Running a TEDx event is like running a company. There are various departments like finances, marketing, logistics etc. that you need to take care of. The memories of TEDxAJCE will remain with me forever and I am always looking forward to newer editions.”",
